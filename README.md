# Space Invaders

This is a game using a Raspberry Pi with a Sense Hat, implemented in Python.
Invaders (red dots) drop in and move their way towards your base (green dot).
You can move your base left and right and shoot using the joystick.
Make sure no invader reaches the surface of your planet!

Execute:
<code> python space-invaders.py
